# ðŸš€ Using Nx in THW Tools Monorepo

This document provides guidance on how to use Nx in our monorepo to improve development workflow and build performance.

## What is Nx?

Nx is a smart, extensible build framework that helps you architect, test, and build at any scale. It provides tools for monorepo management with features like:

- Intelligent caching of build artifacts
- Dependency graph visualization
- Affected commands that only run tasks for projects affected by changes
- Parallel task execution
- Code generation tools

## Getting Started

Nx has been integrated into our monorepo alongside our existing pnpm workspace setup. The main scripts in `package.json` have been updated to use Nx instead of Turborepo.

### Key Commands

```bash
# Build all projects
pnpm build

# Build a specific project
pnpm build:thw-tools
pnpm build:backend
pnpm build:inventar

# Run tests across all projects
pnpm test

# Run linting across all projects
pnpm lint

# Visualize the project dependency graph
pnpm graph
```

## Advanced Nx Usage

### Running Tasks Only on Affected Projects

One of the most powerful features of Nx is the ability to run tasks only on projects affected by your changes:

```bash
# Run build only on affected projects
pnpm exec nx affected -t build

# Run tests only on affected projects
pnpm exec nx affected -t test

# See which projects would be affected by your changes
pnpm exec nx graph --affected
```

### Caching

Nx automatically caches task results. If you run a task that has been run before with the same inputs, Nx will use the cached result instead of running the task again:

```bash
# Clear the Nx cache
pnpm exec nx reset

# Run a task with verbose output to see caching in action
pnpm exec nx build thw-tools --verbose
```

### Running Tasks in Parallel

Nx automatically runs tasks in parallel when possible:

```bash
# Run multiple tasks in parallel
pnpm exec nx run-many -t build,test,lint
```

### Project-specific Commands

You can run any npm script defined in a project's package.json using Nx:

```bash
# Run a specific command for a project
pnpm exec nx run thw-tools:dev
pnpm exec nx run thw-tools-backend:start:dev
```

## Project Structure

Our monorepo is organized as follows:

- `apps/` - Contains all applications
  - `thw-tools/` - THW Tools web application
  - `inventar/` - Inventory management application
  - `backend/` - Backend API server
- `packages/` - Contains shared libraries
  - `web-components/` - Shared web components
  - `svelte-components/` - Shared Svelte components
