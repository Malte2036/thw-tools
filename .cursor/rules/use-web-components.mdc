The component library in `packages/web-components` provides reusable UI components for all frontend applications in the monorepo. Follow these guidelines when using shared components:

#### Importing Components

Import components using the configured path alias:

```typescript
// Import a specific component
import { Button } from '@web-components/Button';
import { Card } from '@web-components/Card';

// Import multiple components
import { Button, Input, Select } from '@web-components/forms';
```

#### Component Props and Types

Always use TypeScript interfaces for component props:

```typescript
  // Use the component with proper typing
  import { Button, type ButtonProps } from '@web-components/Button';

  // Example usage in a Svelte component
  <Button
    variant="primary"
    size="md"
    disabled={isLoading}
    on:click={handleClick}
  >
    Submit
  </Button>
```

#### Styling Guidelines

- Don't override component styles directly; use the provided props for customization
- For layout adjustments, wrap components in layout containers
- Use the theme variables defined in the component library

#### Creating New Shared Components

When creating new components for the shared library:

1. Follow the established naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive TypeScript types
3. Write unit tests for all components
4. Document usage examples in component comments
5. Ensure components work across all frontend applications

#### Cursor Rule for LLM


This rule should be applied whenever suggesting or generating code for any frontend application in this monorepo (thw-tools, inventar) that involves UI components. Apply these guidelines when:
- Creating new frontend components
- Modifying existing components that use shared UI elements
- Implementing new features that require UI components
- Refactoring UI code to improve consistency
- Suggesting component usage patterns or examples

When suggesting code that uses shared components:

- Always import from `@web-components/[ComponentName]`
- Use proper TypeScript typing for all component props
- Follow the component API as defined in the component library
- Suggest using composition over direct style overrides
- Recommend the most appropriate component for the use case
